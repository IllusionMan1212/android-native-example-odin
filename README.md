This is a basic Android native example written completely in Odin. It adapts and rewrites mmozeiko's [C example](https://github.com/mmozeiko/android-native-example) to work with Odin.

This requires that you write some basic bindings to the Android NDK (or use mine https://github.com/illusionman1212/ndk-odin) in order to compile and run.

# Building

### Prerequisites
- The Android SDK must be installed and the appropriate Odin environment variables must be set.
- The `keytool` binary must be in your PATH

### Steps
Run `build.sh` to build and install the app, and `launch.sh` to run the application:
